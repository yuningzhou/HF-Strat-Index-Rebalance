# Index-Rebalancing-Strategy-for-HF
Index rebalancing arbitrage strategy can gain from the expected price change caused by index rebalance. When a stock gets in or out of the index, its price will change in the short term due to a large number of transactions in one direction. This is called the price pressure hypothesis, and there is another hypothesis supporting the alpha in index rebalancing arbitrage, which is the index membership hypothesis. The index membership hypothesis states that the membership of the index has a positive value to the newly added stock as index inclusion increases liquidity and decreases the trading cost. Hence, the direction of the price change could be expected for the newly added or deleted stocks and to make a profit through the strategy.
